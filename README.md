# Tableau_AirBnBProject
# Seattle Airbnb Data Visualization with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing Seattle Airbnb data using Tableau. The dataset provides insights into Airbnb activity in Seattle, WA, USA. The project involves merging data from three separate CSV files into a single Excel file and then creating a comprehensive dashboard to explore and analyze the data.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). It includes the following three CSV files:

- **Listings.csv**: Contains information on Airbnb listings, including full descriptions and average review scores.
- **Reviews.csv**: Contains reviews with unique IDs for each reviewer and detailed comments.
- **Calendar.csv**: Contains listing IDs, prices, and availability for each day.

### Data Merging

For ease of analysis, the three CSV files were merged into a single Excel file:

- **Tableau Full Project.xlsx**: The consolidated file used for visualization in Tableau.

## Final Output

- **Tableau Full Project.twbx**: The Tableau workbook containing the complete dashboard for visualizing and interacting with the Seattle Airbnb data.
